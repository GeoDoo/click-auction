# Small-Iterative Pragmatic Development Rules

## Default Delivery Style
- Work in **small increments** with fast feedback loops.
- Prefer a sequence of small PRs/commits over one large change.

## Change Sizing
- Default to changes that can be reviewed in minutes, not hours.
- If the task is large, break it into steps:
  1) scaffolding / test harness
  2) minimal working path
  3) edge cases
  4) refactor/cleanup
  5) docs

## Pragmatism Over Purity
- Prefer a correct, maintainable, incremental solution over a “perfect” redesign.
- Avoid rewrites unless there is a clear requirement.

## Backwards Compatibility & Safety
- Avoid breaking APIs. If unavoidable, introduce deprecation paths or compatibility layers.
- For risky changes, propose feature flags or guarded rollouts.

## Feedback & Verification
- After each increment, specify what to run to verify (tests/commands).
- If verification is not possible, state what is missing and request the smallest artifact.

## Communication Format
When proposing a plan:
- Provide a step-by-step incremental plan with concrete deliverables per step
- Keep each step independently shippable
